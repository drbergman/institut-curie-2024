# PhysiCell Studio Setup Guide 
Last Updated Oct 2, 2024. 

This guide will help you set up PhysiCell Studio  with a pre-compiled  executable model (`project`) for their computer (currently just Windows or Mac). 
It will let you create rules-based simulation models without additional complex setup (e.g., C++ compilers). You need Python 3 installed on your computer (which will include the `pip3` command used below). Verify that you do and if not, install it:

## Step 1) Install Python (if you don't have it)

### On Windows:
Follow these steps or see the Anaconda option below.
```
* open a Command Line or Powershell terminal and type "python"
If it comes back with "Python 3.xx.xx" then you should be good.
You can type "quit()" at the Python prompt (">>>") to exit the interpreter.
```

Otherwise, if it says "command not found", then download and install Python 3.11 from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/search?query=python&hl=en-us&gl=US).

### On a Mac:
Follow these steps or see the Anaconda option (next).
```
* open a Terminal shell and type "python"
If it comes back with "Python 3.xx.xx" then you should be good.
You can type "quit()" at the Python prompt (">>>") to exit the interpreter.
```
Otherwise, if it says "command not found", then download and install the latest "macOS 64-bit universal2 installer" from [www.python.org/downloads/macos/](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/).

### Platform independent: install the Anaconda Python
* https://www.anaconda.com/download (note there's a "Skip registration" option) - this option will figure out what operating system you are running and download the appropriate Python package. It will be somewhat large, but will contain most of the dependencies for the Studio.
